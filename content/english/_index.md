# Jasper Alexander

&nbsp;

Welcome to my website! I am a full stack developer based in the Netherlands, working with various programming languages and frameworks, and have experience building web applications.

My interests extend beyond web development, as I am passionate about artificial intelligence and its potential to drive efficiency and innovation across multiple industries. Additionally, I enjoy exploring decentralised systems and studying economics to better understand how technology can foster economic growth and improve society as a whole.

In this fast-paced world of technology, I make an effort to stay informed about the latest trends and advancements. My website serves as a platform to showcase my projects, skills, and experiences, as well as my blog, where I share my thoughts on the ever-evolving tech landscape. I invite you to browse through the content and learn more about my work and interests.
