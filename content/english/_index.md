# Jasper Alexander

&nbsp;

I am a full stack developer based in the Netherlands, working with various programming languages and frameworks, and have experience building web applications.

My passion for decentralised systems has led me to explore the potential of blockchain technology and its various applications. I am interested in the ways in which decentralisation can be used to create more transparent and equitable systems.

In addition to my work in the tech field, I have a keen interest in economics and politics. I am interested in understanding the ways in which these fields intersect with technology, and how they can be used to create a more just and equitable society.
